"""Pytest configuration.

The test suite uses ``absltest.TestCase`` helpers (e.g. ``create_tempdir``),
which read absl flags such as ``--test_tmpdir``. Those flags are only parsed by
``absltest.main()``; under the pytest runner they are never parsed, raising
``UnparsedFlagAccessError``. Parse them here so absltest-based tests work under
pytest.
